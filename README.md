# ZotRent
**Developed for the 2024 Web Jam Hackathon at UC Irvine.**

ZotRent is a front-end web application designed to simplify the process of exploring off-campus housing options at UC Irvine. Students can conveniently browse available subleases and view listings in a user-friendly interface. Although ZotRent is currently front-end only (no database or backend integration), it provides a solid starting point for a more comprehensive, community-driven rental platform in the future.



## Features

- **Browse Subleases:** View mock listings with details like rent range, duration, and amenities.  
- **Filters & Search:** Narrow down options based on price, room type, distance from campus, and other factors.  
- **Intuitive UI:** Enjoy a polished, responsive interface that’s easy to navigate.

*Note: All listing data is currently static or mock data. There is no server or database integration at this time.*

## Technologies Used

- **React** – Core library for building the UI  
- **Vite** – Fast development environment and build tool  
- **Material UI (MUI)** – Pre-styled React components and a cohesive design system  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
